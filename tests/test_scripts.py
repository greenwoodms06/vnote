"""Guardrails for the files in scripts/.

Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less .ps1 files as ANSI, so any non-ASCII
byte can mangle into a curly quote and break parsing (an em-dash inside a
string did exactly that). Same failure family as pystray's latin-1 titles:
everything consumed by Windows-side tooling stays pure ASCII.
